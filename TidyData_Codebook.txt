Codebook for Tidy Dataset
============================

Measurements were obtained using the accelerometer and gyroscope features on a Samsung Galaxy SII smartphone.
Triaxial observations (XYZ) were obtained at a constant rate of 50 Hz from each instrument, and are denoted with
the words "Acceleration" and "Gyroscope."

Acceleration signals were partitioned into body and gravity acceleration signals, and are denoted as such with
"Body" and "Gravity."  Body acceleration and angular velocity were calculated in time to obtain "Jerk" signals.
And the "Magnitude" of those signals were also calculated.

Frequency calcluations were created from the fast Fourier transofrmation on some of the variables and
are labeled with "Frequency."

As noted in the accompanying README file, the average mean and average standard deviations of all of these
observations were calculated to create the final dataset.
